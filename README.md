## Conclusion

BuzzChat was by far my toughest project to date. I faced numerous challenges, especially integrating Socket.io for real-time chat and ensuring a responsive design.Before starting the project, I made a deliberate decision to explore new approaches. Instead of local state updates, I opted for global state management using Redux Toolkit. This decision proved challenging, particularly in managing asynchronous thunks and global state, but it was a valuable learning experience.
